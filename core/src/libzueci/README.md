# libzueci

A simple, standalone, BSD-3-Clause C library for converting UTF-8 to/from Extended Channel Interpretations, as
defined by AIM ITS/04-023 International Technical Standard - Extended Channel Interpretations Part 3: Register
(Version 2, February 2022).

The libzueci project is hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/libzueci/. After a longer discussion in
https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp/issues/332 and https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp/issues/377 it was
decided to prevent a dependency on the lib as an external project and copy the relevant files directly into
this repository.
